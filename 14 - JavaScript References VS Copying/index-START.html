    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    const team = players
    console.log(team, players) // ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy']

    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    team[3] = 'Lux' //['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Lux']
      //team is a reference to the origianl array, which is players
      //when you edit/update the original array, it's always going to go back
      //to go back to the reference where it was
    // however what happens when we update that array?
      //it will always reference back
    // now here is the problem!
    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!
    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
    const team2 = players.slice() //['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'] slice creates a copy (no mutation :D)
    team2[3] = 'Lux' // ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Lux']
    console.log(players) // ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy']
    // one day

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const team3 = [].concat(players) //works the same way as slice

    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const team4 = [...players]

    const team5 = Array.from(players)
    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects

    const person = {
      name: 'Krystal Handler'
      age: '69'
    }

    // and think we make a reference to the original object:

    const captain = person
    captain.number = 99

    // how do we take a copy instead?

    const captain2 = Object.assign({}, person, { number: 99 })
    console.log(captain2) // Object {name: "Krystal Handler", age: 69, number: 99}

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread

    const captain3 = {...person}

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects.
    // lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.

    const Wes = {
      name: 'Wes',
      age: 100,
      social: {
        twitter: '@wesbos'
        facebook: 'wesbos.developer'
      }
    }

    console.log(wes)

    const dev = Object.assign({}, wes)

      //The poor man's deep clone
      
    const dev2 = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(wes))
      //so you stringify the object and immediately turn it back into an object
      //and this gives you a full copy of the object
